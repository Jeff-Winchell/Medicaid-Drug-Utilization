Download the 5 programming files (batch, python, SQL and Power BI types) and the two csv files.

Most of the code expects all files to be in the same directory of an arbitrary name, but a couple places they refer to the specific directory I used (C:\Code\Medicaid). If you want your files elsewhere, make the relevant subdirectory name changes in Import_Data_Into_SQL_Server.sql

Run the data_setup.bat file to download about 2GB of data from the US medicaid website and load all data into SQL Server

Open the Power BI file, which has connections specific to my computer name. So change that name to your computer name. (If you run SQL Server on a separate machine, you'll need to make some additional changes to the batch file.

The three image files are screenshots taken from the Power BI file.
